JS-Callback-Patterns-
=====================

A collection of simple scripts that highlight how callbacks work in Javascript.

Tic-Tac-Toe and Towers of Hanoi use the 'readline' module from node.js for getting text input from the terminal.

1. add_numbers - simple adding function that executes a given callback function upon completion.
2. clock - demo of the setInterval function.
3. crazy_bubble_sort - an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using callbacks instead of the traditional nested loops.
4. hanoi - the Towers of Hanoi game using a chain of callbacks as the main game loop.
5. tic-tac-toe - uses the same game loop structure as Hanoi. Incorporates a quick, one-turn-ahead computer AI.
